      content="Inspired by a wide panel of electronic genres, between dub techno, IDM, drum and bass, dubstep, tribalistic world music, ambient, trip hop, psychedelic rock & goa trance, Cyberlife, who got rooted years ago in the techno culture, brings the ambition to shape a very personal style, surfing on forward thinking, psychedelic, hypnotic and melancholic vibes. By applying layers of effects on stretched field recordings or destructured analog synths jams on a large scale of tempos, the exploration of the meanders of the matrix of electronic music defines his director line, with an aim to find transcendance and reveal a futuristic and organic universe. As both DJ and producer, he gets a natural attraction for modern and organic sounds, mixing with old school influences. Don't look for the nerd behind this name, keep the mystery and unpredictability, and share a musical mindtrip."
